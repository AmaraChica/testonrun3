    <h2>Teaching </h2>
    <h5>NIDA Business School - MBA Program</h5>
        <p><b>AB8888 Foundations of Management</b><br>
          This course will provide students with the theories, concepts, and analytical frameworks that are
          fundamental to understanding business management. Specifically, this course is designed to enhance
          students’ understanding of the role and responsibilities of management, and to increase students’
          expertise in a variety of management functions of a firm. This perspective and these abilities are
          essential for all managers, whether they assume the responsibilities of a manager or pursue a career
          as a functional or technical specialist. This course will also show how students’ experiences and
          other courses are relevant to the life of a manager.<br><br>
          <b>
          BA7811 Neuroscience for Strategic Leadership</b><br>
          This course will provide students with an understanding of the concepts and techniques derived
          from the latest neuroscience research and psychology that can improve students’ strategic leadership
          and team working skills. The course will cover topics such as the role of neuroplasticity in
          promoting personal/organizational resilience, unleashing brain agility and cognitive diversity for
          leadership development, understanding how neural constraints can lead to poor decision making and
          how to avoid such decisions, and understanding how emotional contagion and emotional
          intelligence can impact team and employee engagement, in particular incentivizing employees and
          managing conflict among employees. The course will be conducted through lectures, discussions,
          hands-on exercises, and demonstrations at NIDA Management Insight Lab.<br><br>
          <b>BA7812 Applied Neuroscience for Business</b><br>
          This course will provide an understanding of how neuroscience principles can be applied to business
          and management practice. The course will cover topics such as applying brain training and cognitive
          enhancement to enhance perspective taking, reduce bias and assumptions, improve creative thinking
          and innovation, and adjust and response to transformational change. The course will also cover
          topics such as applying neuroscience to enhance productivity and cultural fit as well as
          understanding and shaping stakeholder decisions. The course will be conducted through lectures,
          discussions, hands-on exercises, and demonstrations at NIDA Management Insight Lab.<br><br>
          <b>BA9000 Independent Study</b><br>
          This course is designed to allow students to undertake advanced-level investigations of a company’s
          issues and performance. Students will conduct a business audit by analyzing the symptoms,
          problems, and the root causes of such problems that a company faces. Students will then propose a
          strategic plan that integrates the various business functions of the company to solve the company’s
          problem and re-position it for the future.<br></p>
          <h5>NIDA Business School - PhD Program</h5>
          <p><b>BA8518 Seminar in Strategic and Contemporary Management</b><br>
            The purpose of this seminar is to provide students with a broad historical and current understanding of
            the history, theoretical underpinnings, empirical methods, and current issues in the field of strategic
            management. The course should be approached as an opportunity to gain exposure to the entire field
            
            of strategic management. In the first half of the course, we will start with a discussion on theoretical
            perspectives in strategy by drawing upon theories and concepts from economics, sociology, psychology,
            as well as strategy papers that focus on the integration of theories. In the second half of the course, we
            will discuss topical areas of strategy research, such as product and geographic diversification, M&#38;As,
            alliances, corporate governance, top management teams, as well as new directions in strategy research.<br><br>
          <b>BA 9900 Dissertation</b><br>
            This course is designed to guide students in conduct in-depth, original, and systematic investigation
            of a topic related to an area of specialization in business. Topics of discussion will include starting
            your research trajectory, working with your advisor, finding research ideas, developing hypotheses,
            writing the methods and discussion sections, as well as submitting to journals and responding to
            reviewers.<br></p>
            <h5>Teachings at Other Universities</h5>
